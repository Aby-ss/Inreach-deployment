- The first stage of the cold emailing is to have a clear intent for the outreach. This is the most important part of the offer that you can craft as it determines how successful in theory your proposition is on paper before the client has even opened the email. For example, a business who provided face masks to cooperations and businesses in the covid era had the right intent, timing and were successful in most their outreaches
- One of the best examples of crafting a successful intent is by looking at the latest company trends. 3 common intent lookouts are : the company is hiring, people are changing roles or the company is raising funds and more …
    - If a company is hiring, the sales team could be assisted with boosting growth without many sales which saves them funds that they pay us on a monthly recurring basis. Use LinkedIn Sales navigator filter
    - If someone is changing roles, generally you are looking to introduce new tactics and tools within your first 90 days
    - If a company raises funds, this means they obviously have some money to spend, yet this also means they are looking to grow their business faster. You can also learn about their initiative this way because their fund raising campaign may contain an article which states the mission and goal for this fund raising routine
    - New Location opening can also mean that a business is looking to expand their operations and are looking to employ tools that could help them achieve this online or offline through many different services. This also indirectly means that the company has sufficient funds or has little funds left for the business expansion or productivity growth
    - Layoffs are a great way to target companies as they are looking to cut costs while replacing the current employees with agencies, tools and new employees are may provide 2x productivity and growth while costing the business less money in the long term
    - End of Quarter is a great way to target the businesses looking to make a change in the next business quarter, by researching the company’s background to identify common threats to their income stream this quarter and target these weaknesses as a pain point with your services acting as the medicine and remedy for the business to power into a growth filled quarter
- We can get very immersed in what we sell that we mostly talk about our services in the email and not focus on the prospect’s pain points and do not talk about them enough in the text. Make it about them, not about you. An interesting email contains :
— Interesting subject line that sparks attention
— Personalised intro line resonating with prospect
— Your pitch centered around value for your prospect
— Clear CTA (Call-to-action)
- Always start the email with text that sets you apart from others by doing some research and resonating with their team, then start by listing some issues that you think they could be facing or might be struggling to fix. This creates an opportunity to market your services as a helping tool which is still centered around the value the prospect will gain
- First rule of a great subject line : Keep it personal. Always make a subject line that sparks attention by clearly resounding with their company. You should also avoid a list of spam words that could result in your emails ending up in the spam folder : act now, congratulations, 100% FREE, no fees, win, make money, limited time, call now, you’re a winner, not spam and etc
- Just adding the companies name is not enough personalisation, you must add more context to make your emails stand out and make it look like you have done your research. Here are 2 ways to achieving just that :
    - Try more specific variable, customise your subject line with words like pain points, competitor, common grounds or objective
    - Another way to personalise the subject line is to ask your prospect a question, if it’s relevant. Be very specific as it should resonate with the prospect at a deeper level, for example : “need help with [pain point] ?” and challenge their expectations by asking them : “happy with 50% operating ?”

Few Subject Line Examples :
—  Love your last article/post
—  Last Call, [first name], closing soon
—  Little surprise for you [first name]
—  Collaboration with [domain]
—  [first name], how about we have a chat ?
—  Ideas for [pain points]
—  Question about company culture @[company name]
—  Hey [first name], congrats on your funding run
—  Build [company name] like [common interest]

- Best introductions are value-based, so when you straight right a way promise to sell them with efficiency or with game-changing info without any string attached, start strong by introducing what’s in it for them and once they are engaged, you have the green light to pursue them. For example : “I’ve got a hack to slash your content production by half”. Make it about them, not about you
- Another great intro is when you highlight their achievements and stats or latest wins. Use the company news to build the intro line. In addition to a company milestone, you could also use the intro line to celebrate someone’s promotion, birthday or celebratory event at the company in their employee culture
- A great intro should not only make a deeper connection to showcase that you’ve been following the company culture and news at a closer interest level but also make a connection to your offer and position you as the next part on the subject
- Obsess over your prospects problem, you should make it your focus to show the client what’s in it for them and how they can benefit from your resources. A self-centered email is a very bad example to a successful campaign, aim to create a relationship and meaningful connection that benefits them as a by-product
- Another common mistake is to focus on too many pain points, at a time you should only fix 1-3 pain points with only one main problem which your service will promise to solve. This guarantees a positive feedback as you achieve exactly what you said you will set out to do without a long list of left out pain points making your efforts seem less → Include numbers to build social proof
- Utilise a Push-Pull method which starts off as promised with a clear call-to-action and pain points enlisted in the email and at the end, mention “If you’re busy, I can understand”. The idea here is not to be too pushy and demanding off of your prospect
